                <h2>How to improve store-bought refrigerated cinnamon buns</h2>
                <p>Lately I have been craving cinnamon buns, but I haven’t had time to make them from scratch, so I have been looking at ways of improving the taste of store bought refrigerated cinnamon buns. I was ecstatic when I discovered this article <a href="https://greatist.com/eat/how-to-make-store-bought-cinnamon-rolls-taste-homemade">4 Easy Ways to Make Refrigerated Cinnamon Rolls Taste Homemade</a> by C. Thi Nguyen from the <a href="https://greatist.com/">Greatist</a>.</p> 
                <p>The article lists four great ways of improving store bought cinnamon buns such as what toppings to use, added inside extras, being inventive with frosting, and changing its shape. You can do things such as using a maple buttercream frosting and adding pecans inside or make a cinnamon bun with eggnog frosting for the perfect holiday treat. The possibilities are endless. </p>
                <p>The following quote from the article describes a few simple changes that can potentially improve refrigerated cinnamon buns: “Cinnamon buns don’t have to stay in their original shape, either: you can turn them into one giant cinnamon bun for a fun, shareable breakfast centerpiece; make them in a waffle iron for crisp outsides before drizzling with icing or maple syrup; or roll small chunks of cinnamon roll dough into monkey bread”.</p>
                <p>I am always encouraging people to experiment with their baking because that is how some of the best discoveries are made. Without experimenting we wouldn’t have the recipes we know and love. I wouldn’t be able to post about eggnog cinnamon buns or caramel frosted cinnamon buns, both of which are absolutely delicious. I honestly wouldn’t have thought of half the baking recipes that I come across but because of someone else’s innovation and experimentation, I have a tonne of recipes that I absolutely love and hope that you feel the same way. </p>
                <p>It always astonishes me when people add things that theoretically should never work with your baked good but ends up being absolutely delicious, such as bacon on cinnamon buns and doughnuts.</p>
